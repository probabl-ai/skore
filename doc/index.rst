Welcome to ``skore``
====================

.. container:: index-features

   * ``skore`` UI: track and visualize your objects from a user-friendly dashboard

   * ``skore`` machine learning programming assistant: enhancing ``scikit-learn`` classes and functions

#OwnYourDataScience
-------------------

With the ``skore`` UI, data scientists can:

#. Store objects of different types from their Python code: python lists, ``scikit-learn`` fitted pipelines, ``plotly`` figures, and more.
#. **Track** and **visualize** these stored objects on a user-friendly dashboard.
#. Export the dashboard to a HTML file.

With the ``skore`` machine learning programming assistant, data scientists can:

* Use an enhanced version of ``sklearn.model_selection.cross_validate`` with ``skore.cross_validate``.

These are only the first features: skore is a work in progress and aims to be
an end-to-end library for data scientists.
Stay tuned!
