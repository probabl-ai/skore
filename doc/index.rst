   * track and visualize your objects from a user-friendly dashboard

   * scikit-learn compatible

With ``skore``, data scientists can:

#. Store objects of different types from their Python code: python lists, ``scikit-learn`` fitted pipelines, ``plotly`` figures, and more.
#. **Track** and **visualize** these stored objects on a user-friendly dashboard.
#. Export the dashboard to a HTML file.

These are only the first features: skore is a work in progress and aims to be
an end-to-end library for data scientists.
Stay tuned!
