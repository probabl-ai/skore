  Acquire the PR number and the PR commit HEAD sha, after a "workflow_run" event.

  The "workflow_run" context differs from the "pull_request" context and doesn't contain
  PR basic information. This action intends to provide some missing information in the
  "workflow_run" context, without having to explicitly record them in the workflow that
  triggered the "workflow_run" event.

outputs:
  pr-number:
    description: "The PR number"
    value: ${{ steps.acquire-pr-context.outputs.number }}
  pr-head-sha:
    description: "The PR commit HEAD sha"
    value: ${{ steps.acquire-pr-context.outputs.head-sha }}
