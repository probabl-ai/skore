# # BNP Fraudsters - EDA
# 
# ## 1. Introduction
# 
# This challenge is a use-case from by BNP Paribas Personal Finance, hosted on the platform [challengedata.ens.fr](https://challengedata.ens.fr/participants/challenges/104/). The dataset is under a [public and permissive license](https://etalab.gouv.fr/licence-ouverte-open-licence/).
# 
# See the video (in French) of the presentation of the challenge:

# 
# The bank offers credit to customers of retailers and web merchants and is exposed to various frauds. 
# 
# > The Credit Process Optimization team supports local risk teams to improve credit processes' efficiency, balance profitability, customer journey, and risk profiles.
# 
# Although mentioned, the context in which the models are used is not precise enough to derive operational constraints and a precise utility function to optimize. Instead, the challenge suggests maximizing the average precision (i.e. the PR curve AUC). We will stick, however, to a virtual utility function using our best guess.
# 
# By its nature, fraud is a very imbalanced classification problem. Here, the prevalence is close to 1.4%. Therefore, we use stratification strategies to avoid selecting too few positive classes in our analysis and modeling.
# 
# Finally, the features available are rather limited, e.g. we don't have access to customer data, merchant data, or any temporal information. We only have access to the products in the customer basket (up to 24), with the following attributes for each product:
# - item (category of the product)
# - make (brand of the product)
# - model (the name of the model of the product)
# - goods_code (retailer code, we don't have a precise definition of this variable, we assume it is the product reference across different shops)
# - Nbr_of_prod_purchas (the number of products selected)
# - cash_price (the individual price of a single product)
# 
# Since most consumers only select a few different products when applying for a loan, the features are sparse beyond the first two selected products, making fraud detection even more challenging.
# 
# ## 2. Exploring the variables
# 
# The challenge organizers have assembled the data in a single table, which eases our work. Let's load this file:

# In[1]:


MAX_ITEMS = 24

def get_group_cols(column, max_items=MAX_ITEMS):
    """Create a list of column names"""
    return [f"{column}{idx}" for idx in range(1, max_items+1)]


# In[2]:


import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns


X = pd.read_csv("X_train.csv", low_memory=False).convert_dtypes()

# Rename the 24 columns 'Nbr_of_prod_purchas' in a shorter 'nbr'
renaming = dict(
    zip(
        get_group_cols("Nbr_of_prod_purchas"),
        get_group_cols("nbr"),
    )
)
X = X.rename(columns=renaming)

# Display the first item attributes
attribute_cols = ["item", "cash_price", "make", "model", "goods_code", "nbr"]
cols = ["ID", *[f"{col}1" for col in attribute_cols], "Nb_of_items"]
X[cols]


# We see products like electronics or home furnitures, with a price range close to 1000â‚¬. This price range is expected since these buyers used a credit.
# 
# We also see that "item" categories have a semantic (and syntaxic) similarity. For instance, "computers" and "computer peripherals accessories" should be closer in some latent feature space than "computers" and "bedroom furniture".
# 
# The same observation goes for "model", where models mentioning "MACBOOK" should be closer together. There is somewhat of a redundancy between "model" and "make", since the name of the maker is often included in the model.
# 
# "Goods code" is harder to decypher, and may not carry a meaningful encoding. We will explore that later in this analysis.
# 
# We can observe that buyers tend to buy only a single of the first, expensive item. This is also expected in a B2C market, where consumers don't stack TVs in their homes.
# 
# Note that `Nb_of_items` is the number of **unique** items in the basket, while `nbr{i}` is the **number of instances** of the ith item.
# 
# Last but not least, we can intuite that some of our features are hierarchical:

# In[3]:


import graphviz as gr

g = gr.Digraph()
g.edge("item", "model")
g.edge("make", "model")
g.edge("model", "goods_code")
g.edge("goods_code", "ID")
g.edge("cash_price", "ID")
g.edge("nbr", "ID")
g


# Let's check that our IDs are unique:

# In[4]:


X["ID"].nunique() == X.shape[0]


# Then, what is the cardinality of our features? We only select the first item for simplicity.

# In[5]:


cols = ["ID", *[f"{col}1" for col in attribute_cols]]
X[cols].nunique().sort_values()


# Interestingly, the cardinality of the `nbr` integer colunm, is fairly low. It might be worth exploring the link between the risk of fraud and outliers like buying 16 instances of a given product.
# 
# Also, we see that the cardinality conceptually follows our hierarchical structure: `item` < `make` < `model` < `goods_code` < `ID`.
# 
# Let's go further and describe the relationship between `model` and `goods_code`. How many different models are attributed to each `goods_code`?

# In[6]:


model_per_code = (
    X.groupby("goods_code1")["model1"].nunique()
    .sort_values(ascending=False)
)
model_per_code


# Some codes are associated to up to 3 different models. We give an example below:

# In[7]:


X.query("goods_code1 == '239001437'")["model1"].unique()


# Some codes aren't linked to any model, which is confusing but could be due to a data entry issue.

# In[8]:


X.query("goods_code1 == '239773630'")["model1"]


# Let's quantify these different categories:

# In[9]:


model_per_code.value_counts(normalize=True)


# Most codes are linked to a single model (82%), but we see that there is not a 1:N relationship like we previously conjectured.
# 
# Let's reproduce this experiment with the pairs `item` - `model` and `make` - `item`.

# In[10]:


item_by_model = (
    X.groupby("model1")["item1"].nunique()
    .sort_values(ascending=False)
)
item_by_model


# Surprisingly, there is not strict 1:N relationship here either. In particular, "RETAILER" is an outlier.

# In[11]:


X.query("model1 == 'RETAILER'")["item1"].value_counts().head()


# So "RETAILER" looks like an alternative, catch-all model, encompassing many item kinds. What about the Sony Bravia tv?

# In[12]:


model = "SONY BRAVIA KE48A9 2020 OLED HDR 4K ULTRA HD SMART"
X.query("model1 == @model")["item1"].value_counts().head()


# Finally, let's explore the link between `model` and `make`.

# In[13]:


item_by_model = (
    X.groupby("model1")["make1"].nunique()
    .sort_values(ascending=False)
)
item_by_model


# We again see the "RETAILER" model being linked to different maker. Apart from that, only a single model is linked to different makers.

# In[14]:


X.query("model1 == 'MADE TO MEASURE CURTAINS'")["make1"].value_counts().head()


# So "RETAILER" is a model but also a maker, which starts to be confusing.

# In[15]:


X.loc[(X == "RETAILER").any(axis=1)]


# ## 3. Exploring the target
# 
# We now switch gears and load the target, before merging it with the feature table.

# In[16]:


y = pd.read_csv("Y_train.csv", index_col="index")
y


# As a safety measure and to mitigate the risk of overfitting, we only analyse the data we will later use for training.

# In[17]:


from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

target_col = "fraud_flag"
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=.1, stratify=y[target_col],
)
X_train.shape, X_test.shape, y_train.shape, y_test.shape


# We merge our training dataset with our training target to derive more insights.

# In[18]:


df = X_train.merge(y_train, on="ID")
df.shape


# Our very imbalanced target distribution:

# In[19]:


palette = sns.color_palette('colorblind', n_colors=2)
ax = df[target_col].value_counts().plot.bar(color=palette);
ax.bar_label(ax.containers[0])
print(df[target_col].value_counts(normalize=True))


# One thousand positive class is fairly low, but should be enough to ensure some predictive power.
# 
# Next, we want to make sure that `Nb_of_items` is correlated with the number of items that aren't None, for all item attributes.

# In[20]:


for col in attribute_cols:
    cols = get_group_cols(col)
    n_not_nulls = df[cols].notnull().sum(axis=1)
    corr = np.corrcoef(n_not_nulls, df['Nb_of_items'])[0][1]
    print(col, f"{corr:.4f}")


# That assumption looks correct. 
# 
# Let's now answer a question we asked previously, by displaying the distribution of the number of **unique** items given the fraud.

# In[21]:


fig, axes = plt.subplots(nrows=2, sharex=True, sharey=True)
for idx, ax in enumerate(axes):
    sns.histplot(
        df.loc[df[target_col] == idx]["Nb_of_items"],
        log_scale=[True, False],
        bins=MAX_ITEMS,
        binwidth=.1,
        stat="probability",
        color=palette[idx],
        ax=ax,
    );
    ax.set_title(f"{target_col}: {idx}")
    ax.grid()


# It's quite clear that extremely few baskets have more than 5 different items in them.
# 
# We see that there is a higher proportion of basket with 2 items in the fraud case.
# 
# Are there specific categories of items where frauders buy more different product?

# In[22]:


from eda_plots import plot_n_items_per_basket

plot_n_items_per_basket(df, n_most_freq=10)


# The most striking difference is with the computers category: fraudsters order 2 different computers 5% of the time, while legit buyers do so less than 1% of the time.
# 
# Fulfilment charge is never ordered twice.
# 
# This raises a related question: do frauders buy more instances of the same article? E.g. several pairs of Apple airpods or more than one computer of the same model?

# In[23]:


from eda_plots import plot_nbr_per_item

plot_nbr_per_item(df, n_most_freq=10)


# Fraudsters don't stand out on buying the same item multiple times, so we can expect the `nbr{i}` feature to play little role in the fraud prediction performance.
# 
# So, a frauders' trick could be to buy different computer models instead of the same model multiple times.

# ## 4. Price distribution
# 
# We can expect price to be a significant feature for prediction. Let's start by computing the total basket price.

# In[24]:


def compute_total_price(df):
    price_cols = get_group_cols("cash_price")
    nbr_cols = get_group_cols("nbr")
    df["total_price_"] = 0
    for price_col, nbr_col in zip(price_cols, nbr_cols):
        df["total_price_"] += df[price_col].fillna(0) * df[nbr_col].fillna(0)
    return df

df = compute_total_price(df)


# In[25]:


from eda_plots import plot_price_distribution

plot_price_distribution(df)


# Letâ€™s estimate a very simple model. We will regress log price of baskets on the fraud indicator. We use logs here so that [our parameter estimates have a percentage interpretation](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/244199/why-is-it-that-natural-log-changes-are-percentage-changes-what-is-about-logs-th). With it, we will be able to say that a fraud yields a price increase of x%.

# In[26]:


import statsmodels.formula.api as smf

result = smf.ols(f'np.log(total_price_) ~ {target_col}', data=df).fit()
result.summary().tables[1]


# The difference in price means between the fraud and the legit credits is significant. By using the log of the total price, 
# we find that a fraud increases the price of the basket by 26.9%.

# In[27]:


df.query(f"{target_col} == 0")["total_price_"].describe()


# In[28]:


df.query(f"{target_col} == 1")["total_price_"].describe()


# Interestingly, the fraudster maximum outlier is far from the maximum legit basket, and the median are lower than the means, indicating a skew toward the large values.
# 
# We now display the price distribution of the item categories that are the most subject to fraud:

# In[29]:


from eda_plots import plot_multiple_price_dist

plot_multiple_price_dist(df, n_most_freq=10)


# Computers, phones, audio accessory and home cinema show a difference in means that looks significant.

# ## 5. Co-occurence graph
# 
# We now studies the co-occurences of items and models.

# In[30]:


def clean_items(df):
    """Small cleaning step.
    """
    for item_col in get_group_cols("item"):
        df[item_col] = df[item_col].str.replace("& ", "").str.replace(",", "")
    return df

df = clean_items(df)


# We begin with plotting the co-occurence graph of the legit credits.
# 
# The size of the nodes is proportional to the frequency of the represented entities (either item or make), and the width of the edges is proportional to the co-occurence of their two nodes. We only represent the most frequent entities, as speficied by the `top` argument.

# In[31]:


from eda_plots import plot_graph

plot_graph(
    df.loc[df[target_col] == 0],
    column="item",
    top=40,
)


# Computers are the most represented category, and seems to go in pair with fulfilment charge.
# 
# Let's now plot the same graph for fraudulent credits only:

# In[32]:


plot_graph(
    df.loc[df[target_col] == 1],
    column="item",
    top=40,
    node_color="coral",
)


# Computer and fulfilment charge are still the most represented items, but we also notice a diversification around tableware and decorative accessories.
# 
# We now focus on the co-occurence of the brands:

# In[33]:


plot_graph(
    df.loc[df[target_col] == 0],
    column="make",
    top=40,
)


# We understand that the fulfilment charge are provided by the retailer for many different products, and as we previously saw, this is not a huge differenciator for fraud. Apple (and to a lesser extend, Samsung) is the previous computers and phone nodes.

# In[34]:


plot_graph(
    df.loc[df[target_col] == 1],
    column="make",
    top=40,
    node_color="coral",
)


# Microsoft, Sony and LG are visibly less prefered by fraudsters.
# 
# We can also notice the subgraph created by the smaller categories, whereas the previous legit graph was more centralized around RETAILER.
# 
# To get a more exhaustive perspective on these graph relations, we can focus on the adjacency matrix of two columns, and observe which combinations had seen the most frauds.

# In[35]:


def plot_adjacency_matrix(df, col1, col2, figsize=(9, 7)):
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=figsize)
    df = (
        df.groupby([col1, col2])[target_col]
          .sum()
          .reset_index()
          .pivot(index=col1, columns=col2, values=target_col)
    )
    sns.heatmap(df, center=df.max(axis=None), ax=ax)

plot_adjacency_matrix(df.loc[df[target_col] == 1], "item1", "item2")


# In[36]:


plot_adjacency_matrix(df.loc[df[target_col] == 1], "item2", "item3")


# Notice how the maximum value of the colorbar shrinks when we go from the item1/item2 matrix to the item2/item3 matrix.
# 
# Fulfilment charge appears at multiple positions. One hypothesis is that it is automatically added to the basket after the last item.
# 
# The following plot drills into brands to show the models that are the most targeted by fraudsters.

# In[37]:


plot_adjacency_matrix(
    df.loc[df[target_col] == 1],
    "model1",
    "make1",
    figsize=(20, 30),
)


# Noticeably, Apple MacBook Air and MacBook Pro models are the most subject to fraud.

# ## 6. Marginal fraud ratios
# 
# We just saw that Apple products were the most targeted by fraud in absolute numbers. We now compare items and makers individually, relatively to the average fraud ratio.

# In[38]:


from eda_plots import plot_fraud_ratio

plot_fraud_ratio(df, "item")


# Items that are on the right of the red dashed line have a higher fraud ratio than the global average. The blue bars quantify the total number of fraud that occured for the same categories. Notably, audio accessories are 3x more likely to be linked to a fraud that the average.
# 
# We reproduce the same graph with makers:

# In[39]:


plot_fraud_ratio(df, column="make")


# No brands stand out, and the ones with the highest fraud ratio have actually seen very few fraud cases. Apple is super close to the average, which is not surprising because due to its number of purchase, it actually sets the average.
# 
# Finally, let's run this graph one more time for the models.

# In[40]:


plot_fraud_ratio(df, column="model", figsize=(20, 30))


# We see that MacBook pro are actually quite average in terms of fraud ratio, compared to e.g. AirPods Pro. Some Airpods Pro models are subject to fraud more than 30% of the time!
