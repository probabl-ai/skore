End-to-end data science use cases
---------------------------------

These examples show `skore` in action on real use case. We aimed at showing `skore`
ability to:

- be compatible with `scikit-learn`
- reduce boilerplate code for some standard *de facto* data science analysis
- speed-up exploration by optimizing some internal computation
