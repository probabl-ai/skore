# We can observe that the year related to the first hired is also present in the date.
# Hence, we should beware of not creating twice the same feature during the feature
# engineering.
#
# By looking at the "Associations" tab, we observe that two features are exactly holding
# the same information: "department" and "department_name". So during our feature
# engineering, we could potentially drop one of them if the final predictive model
# is sensitive to the collinearity.

# In the diagram above, we can see what we intend to do as feature engineering. For
# categorical features, we use a `OneHotEncoder` to transform the categorical features.
# From the previous data exploration, we could have check the unique values from the
# "Stats" tab and observe that we have large cardinality features. In such cases,
# one-hot encoding might not be the best choice but it is our starting point to get the
# ball rolling.
#
# Then, we have another transformation to encode the date features. We first split the
# date into multiple features (day, month, and year). Then, we apply a periodic spline
# transformation to each of the date features to capture the periodicity of the data.
#
# Finally, we fit a :class:`~sklearn.linear_model.RidgeCV` model.
#
# Now, we want to evaluate this complex model via cross-validation. We would like to
# use 5 folds. We use :class:`~skore.CrossValidationReport` to allow us to investigate
# the performance of the model.
