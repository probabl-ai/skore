# üëã Welcome to skore

`skore` allows data scientists to create tracking and visualization from their Python code:
1. Users can store objects of different types: python lists and dictionaries, `numpy` arrays, `scikit-learn` fitted models, `matplotlib`, `altair`, and `plotly` figures, etc. Storing some values over time allows one to perform **tracking** and also to **visualize** them:
2. They can visualize these stored objects on a dashboard. The dashboard is user-friendly: objects can easily be organized.
3. This dashboard can be exported into a HTML file.

These are only the first features of `skore`'s roadmap.
`skore` is a work in progress and, on the long run, it aims to be an all-inclusive library for data scientists.
Stay tuned!

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

You can install `skore` by using `pip`:
```bash
pip install -U skore
```

## üöÄ Quick start
=======

In your shell, run the following to create a project file `project.skore` (the default) in your current working directory:
```bash
python -m skore create 'project.skore'
```

Run the following in your Python code (in the same working directory) to load the project, store some objects, delete them, etc:
```python
from skore import load

# load the project
project = load("project.skore")

# save an item you need to track in your project
project.put("my int", 3)

# get an item's value
project.get("my int")

# by default, strings are assumed to be Markdown:
project.put("my string", "Hello world!")

# `put` overwrites previous data
project.put("my string", "Hello again!")

# list all the keys in a project
print(project.list_item_keys())

# delete an item
project.delete_item("my int")
```

Then, in the directory containing your project, run the following command in your shell to start the UI locally:
```bash
python -m skore launch project.skore
```
This will automatically open a browser at the UI's location.
In the `Elements` tab on the left, you can visualize the stored items.
Create a new `View`, then you can then add items into this view.

üí° Note that after launching the dashboard, you can keep modifying current items or store new ones, and the dashboard will automatically be refreshed.

üë®‚Äçüè´ For a complete introductory example, see our [basic usage notebook](https://github.com/probabl-ai/skore/blob/main/examples/basic_usage.ipynb).
It shows you how to store all types of items: python lists and dictionaries, `numpy` arrays, `scikit-learn` fitted models, `matplotlib`, `altair`, and `plotly` figures, etc.
The resulting `skore` report has been exported to [this HTML file](https://sylvaincom.github.io/files/probabl/skore/basic_usage.html).
