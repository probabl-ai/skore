With skore, data scientists can:
1. Store objects of different types from their Python code: python lists, scikit-learn fitted pipelines, plotly figures, and more.
2. **Track** and  **visualize** these stored objects on a user-friendly dashboard.
3. Export the dashboard to a HTML file.

These are only the first features: skore is a work in progress and aims to be an end-to-end library for data scientists.
Stay tuned, and join [our Discord](https://discord.probabl.ai) if you want to give us feedback!

## ⚙️ Installation

First of all, we recommend using a [virtual environment (venv)](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html). You need `python>=3.9`.

Then, you can install skore by using `pip`:
```bash
pip install -U skore
```

🚨 For Windows users, the encoding must be set to [UTF-8](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#utf-8-mode): see [PYTHONUTF8](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONUTF8).

## 🚀 Quick start

1. From your shell, initialize a skore project, here named `project.skore`, that will be in your current working directory:
```bash
python -m skore create "project.skore"
```
2. Then, from your Python code (in the same directory), load the project and store an integer for example:
```python
from skore import load
project = load("project.skore")
project.put("my_int", 3)
```
3. Finally, from your shell (in the same directory), start the UI locally:
```bash
python -m skore launch "project.skore"
```
This will automatically open a browser at the UI's location:
1. On the top left, create a new `View`.
2. From the `Items` section on the bottom left, you can add stored items to this view, either by double-cliking on them or by doing drag-and-drop.

## 👨‍💻 More examples

💡 Note that after launching the dashboard, you can keep modifying the current items or store new ones from your python code, and the dashboard will automatically be refreshed.

Storing a `pandas` dataframe:
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

my_df = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randn(3, 3))
project.put("my_df", my_df)
```

Storing a `matplotlib` figure:
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(5, 3), layout="constrained")
ax.plot(x)
project.put("my_figure", fig)
```

Storing a scikit-learn fitted pipeline:
```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_diabetes
from sklearn.linear_model import Lasso
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

diabetes = load_diabetes()
X = diabetes.data[:150]
y = diabetes.target[:150]
my_pipeline = Pipeline(
    [("standard_scaler", StandardScaler()), ("lasso", Lasso(alpha=2))]
)
my_pipeline.fit(X, y)
project.put("my_fitted_pipeline", my_pipeline)
```

👨‍🏫 For a complete introductory example, see our [basic usage notebook](https://github.com/probabl-ai/skore/blob/main/examples/01_basic_usage.ipynb).
It shows you how to store all types of items: python lists and dictionaries, numpy arrays, pandas dataframes, scikit-learn fitted models, figures (matplotlib, altair, and plotly), etc.
The resulting skore report has been exported to [this HTML file](https://sylvaincom.github.io/files/probabl/skore/01_basic_usage.html).
