class Project(DirNamesMixin):
    r"""
    API to manage a collection of key-report pairs.

    Its constructor initializes a project by creating a new project or by loading an
    existing one.

    The class main methods are :func:`~skore.Project.put`,
    :func:`~skore.Project.reports.metadata` and :func:`~skore.Project.reports.get`,
    respectively to insert a key-report pair into the project, to obtain the metadata of
    the inserted reports and to get a specific report by its id.

    Two mutually exclusive modes are available and can be configured using the ``name``
    parameter of the constructor:

    .. rubric:: Hub mode

    If the ``name`` takes the form of the URI ``hub://<tenant>/<name>``, the project
    is configured to the ``hub`` mode to communicate with the ``skore hub``.

    A tenant is a ``skore hub`` concept that must be configured on the ``skore hub``
    interface. It represents an isolated entity managing users, projects, and
    resources. It can be a company, organization, or team that operates
    independently within the system.

    In this mode, you must have an account to the ``skore hub`` and must be
    authorized to the specified tenant. You must also be authenticated beforehand,
    using the ``skore-hub-login`` CLI.

    .. rubric:: Local mode

    Otherwise, the project is configured to the ``local`` mode to be persisted on
    the user machine in a directory called ``workspace``.

    The workspace can be shared between all the projects.
    The workspace can be set using kwargs or the envar ``SKORE_WORKSPACE``.
    If not, it will be by default set to a ``skore/`` directory in the USER
    cache directory:

    - in Windows, usually ``C:\Users\%USER%\AppData\Local\skore``,
    - in Linux, usually ``${HOME}/.cache/skore``,
    - in macOS, usually ``${HOME}/Library/Caches/skore``.

    Refer to the :ref:`project` section of the user guide for more details.

    Parameters
    ----------
    name : str
        The name of the project:

        - if the ``name`` takes the form of the URI ``hub://<tenant>/<name>``, the
          project is configured to communicate with the ``skore hub``,
        - otherwise, the project is configured to communicate with a local storage, on
          the user machine.
    **kwargs : dict
        Extra keyword arguments passed to the project, depending on its mode.

        workspace : Path, mode:local only.
            The directory where the local project is persisted.

            The workspace can be shared between all the projects.
            The workspace can be set using kwargs or the envar ``SKORE_WORKSPACE``.
            If not, it will be by default set to a ``skore/`` directory in the USER
            cache directory:

            - in Windows, usually ``C:\Users\%USER%\AppData\Local\skore``,
            - in Linux, usually ``${HOME}/.cache/skore``,
            - in macOS, usually ``${HOME}/Library/Caches/skore``.

    Attributes
    ----------
    name : str
        The name of the project, extrapolated from the ``name`` parameter.
    mode : str
        The mode of the project, extrapolated from the ``name`` parameter.

    Examples
    --------
    Construct reports.

    >>> from sklearn.datasets import make_classification, make_regression
    >>> from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression, LogisticRegression
    >>> from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    >>> from skore.sklearn import EstimatorReport
    >>>
    >>> X, y = make_classification(random_state=42)
    >>> X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, random_state=42)
    >>> classifier = LogisticRegression(max_iter=10)
    >>> classifier_report = EstimatorReport(
    >>>     classifier,
    >>>     X_train=X_train,
    >>>     y_train=y_train,
    >>>     X_test=X_test,
    >>>     y_test=y_test,
    >>> )
    >>>
    >>> X, y = make_regression(random_state=42)
    >>> X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, random_state=42)
    >>> regressor = LinearRegression()
    >>> regressor_report = EstimatorReport(
    >>>     regressor,
    >>>     X_train=X_train,
    >>>     y_train=y_train,
    >>>     X_test=X_test,
    >>>     y_test=y_test,
    >>> )

    Construct the project in local mode, persisted in a temporary directory.

    >>> from pathlib import Path
    >>> from tempfile import TemporaryDirectory
    >>> from skore import Project
    >>>
    >>> tmpdir = TemporaryDirectory().name
    >>> local_project = Project("my-xp", workspace=Path(tmpdir))

    Put reports in the project.

    >>> local_project.put("my-simple-classification", classifier_report)
    >>> local_project.put("my-simple-regression", regressor_report)

    Investigate metadata/metrics to filter the best reports.

    >>> metadata = local_project.reports.metadata()
    >>> metadata = metadata.query("ml_task.str.contains('regression') and (rmse < 67)")
    >>> reports = metadata.reports()
