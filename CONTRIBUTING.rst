Contributing
============

Thank you for your interest in contributing to skore! We welcome contributions from
everyone and appreciate you taking the time to get involved.

This project is hosted on https://github.com/probabl-ai/skore.

Below are some guidelines to help you get started.

Preamble
=========

Our values
-----------

We aspire to treat everybody equally, and value their contributions.
We are particularly seeking people from underrepresented backgrounds in Open Source Software to participate and contribute their expertise and experience.

Decisions are made based on technical merit, consensus, and roadmap priorities.

Code is not the only way to help the project. Reviewing pull requests, answering questions to help others on mailing lists or issues, organizing and teaching tutorials, working on the website, improving the documentation, are all priceless contributions.

We abide by the principles of openness, respect, and consideration of others of the Python Software Foundation: https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/

Automated contributions policy
------------------------------

Please refrain from submitting issues or pull requests generated by fully-automated tools. Maintainers reserve the right, at their sole discretion, to close such submissions and to block any account responsible for them.

Ideally, contributions should follow from a human-to-human discussion in the form of an issue.

Signing commits
---------------

You have to sign your commits before submitting a pull request.
For a pull request to be accepted, all the commits inside of it must be signed.

GitHub supports commit signing using **GPG**, **SSH**, or **S/MIME**. Signed commits are marked as "Verified" on GitHub, providing confidence in the origin of your changes.
For setup instructions and more details, please refer to `GitHub’s guide on signing commits <https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits>`_.

Questions, bugs, and feature requests
=====================================

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out:

* Join our community on `Discord <https://discord.gg/scBZerAGwW>`_ for general chat and Q&A.
* Alternatively, you can `start a discussion on GitHub <https://github.com/probabl-ai/skore/discussions>`_.
* Both bugs and feature requests can be filed in the `GitHub issue tracker <https://github.com/probabl-ai/skore/issues>`_:

When filing an issue:

* Check if your issue does not already exist.
* For `new issues <https://github.com/probabl-ai/skore/issues/new/choose>`_, we recommend some templates but feel free to open a blank issue.
* Use `short, self-contained, correct examples <http://sscce.org/>`_ to help us understand your issue.

Development
===========

Quick start
-----------

You'll need ``python >=3.9, <3.13``.

1.  Fork the skore repository.

2.  Clone your fork.

3.  Create a virtual environment.

4.  Install dependencies and setup pre-commit with:

    .. code-block:: bash

        make install-skore


Choosing an issue
-----------------

If you are new to open-source, you can start by an `issue tagged "good first issue" <https://github.com/probabl-ai/skore/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22good%20first%20issue%22>`_.

The implementation of some issues are not very detailed. You can either propose a solution, or choose only the issues with a "Ready" status.

Pull requests
-------------

Quick start:

-   Create a branch for your changes.

-   Commit your changes.

-   Push to your fork.

-   Submit a pull request to the ``main`` branch.

    -   Link your PR to its corresponding issue (if any).

    -   You can mark your PR as draft if it is not ready to be reviewed by maintainers.

We use the `conventional commits <https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary>`_ format, and we automatically check that the PR title fits this format:

- In particular, commits are "sentence case", meaning that the ``fix: Fix issue`` title passes, while ``fix: fix issue`` does not.
- Generally, the description of a commit should start with a verb in the imperative voice, so that it would properly complete the sentence: ``When applied, this commit will [...]``.
- Examples of correct PR titles: ``docs: Update the docstrings`` or ``feat: Remove CrossValidationAggregationItem``.

Skore is a company-driven project. We might provide extensive help to bring PRs to be merged to meet internal deadlines. In such cases, we will warn you in the PR.

Add a new feature
-----------------

When adding a new feature to skore, please follow these steps:

- **Include unit tests**
   Write thorough tests using `pytest` and place them under the `tests/` directory.
   .. code-block:: bash

       pytest -q

- **Verify existing examples**
   Make sure none of the examples or tutorials break:
   .. code-block:: bash

       pytest examples/

   For notebooks, open and execute them end-to-end (e.g. via JupyterLab or `nbclient`).

- **Update or add examples**
   - **Minor feature**: adjust one existing example to demonstrate your change—avoid creating many tiny example files.
   - **Major feature**: add a single, concise example under `examples/` (or update the gallery) that highlights the new capability.
   
Tests
-----

To run the tests locally, you may run:

.. code-block:: bash

    make test


Linting
-------

We use the linter ruff to make sure that the code is formatted correctly:

.. code-block:: bash

    make lint


Documentation
=============

Setup
-----

Our documentation uses the `PyData Sphinx Theme <https://pydata-sphinx-theme.readthedocs.io/>`_.

To build the docs:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd sphinx
    make html

You can access the local build at:

.. code-block:: bash

    open build/html/index.html

A bot will automatically comment on your PR with a link to a documentation preview. Use this link to verify that your changes render correctly.

Skipping examples when building the docs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The examples can take a long time to build, so if you are not working on them you can instead run the following to avoid building them altogether:

.. code-block:: bash

    make html-noplot

If you are working on an example and wish to only build that one, you can do so by temporarily editing `sphinx/conf.py`.
Follow `the sphinx-gallery documentation <https://sphinx-gallery.github.io/stable/configuration.html#parsing-and-executing-examples-via-matching-patterns>`_ for more information.
By default, the examples that are built are Python files that start with `plot_`.

Note that by default, if an example has not changed since the last time you built it, it will not be re-built.

Contributing to the docstrings
------------------------------

When writing documentation, whether it be online, docstrings or help messages in the CLI and in the UI, we strive to follow some conventions that are listed below. These might be updated as time goes on.

#. The docstring will be compiled using Sphinx numpydoc so use `RST (ReStructured Text) <https://docs.open-mpi.org/en/v5.0.x/developers/rst-for-markdown-expats.html>`_ for bold, URLs, etc.
#. Argument descriptions should be written so that the following sentence makes sense: `Argument <argument> designates <argument description>`
#. Argument descriptions start with lower case, and do not end with a period or other punctuation
#. Argument descriptions start with "the" where relevant, and "whether" for booleans
#. Text is written in US English (use "visualize" rather than "visualise")
#. In the CLI, positional arguments are written in snake case (``snake_case``), keyword arguments in kebab case (``kebab-case``)
#. When there is a default argument, it should be shown in the help message, typically with ``(default: <default value>)`` at the end of the message
#. Use clear, concise language for non-native English speakers.

Contributing to the examples
----------------------------

The examples are stored in the `examples` folder:

- They are organized in subcategories.
- They should be written in a python script (`.py`), with cells marked by `# %%`, to separate code cells and markdown cells, as they will be rendered as notebooks (`.ipynb`).
- The file should start with a docstring giving the example title.
- No example should require to have large files stored in this repository. For example, no dataset should be stored, it should be downloaded in the script.
- When built (using `make html` for example), these examples will automatically be converted into RST files in the `sphinx/auto_examples` subfolder. This subfolder is listed in the gitignore and cannot be pushed.

Contributing to the README
--------------------------

The `README.md` file can be modified and is part of the documentation (although it is not included in the online documentation).
This file is used to be presented on `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/skore/#description>`_.
