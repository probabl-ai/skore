Getting started with ``skore``
==============================

This example builds on top of the :ref:`getting_started` guide.

``skore`` UI
------------

This section provides a quick start to the ``skore`` UI, an open-source package that aims to enable data scientists to:

#. Store objects of different types from their Python code: python lists, ``scikit-learn`` fitted pipelines, ``plotly`` figures, and more.
#. Track and visualize these stored objects on a user-friendly dashboard.
#. Export the dashboard to a HTML file.

Initialize a Project and launch the UI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

From your shell, initialize a skore project, here named ``project``, that will be
in your current working directory:

.. code:: console

    python -m skore create "project"

This will create a ``skore`` project directory named ``project`` in the current
directory.

From your shell (in the same directory), start the UI locally:

.. code:: console

    python -m skore launch "project"

This will automatically open a browser at the UI's location.

Now that the project file exists, we can load it in our notebook so that we can
read from and write to it:

.. code-block:: python

    from skore import load

    project = load("project.skore")

Storing some items
------------------

Storing an integer:

.. code-block:: python

    project.put("my_int", 3)

Here, the name of my stored item is ``my_int`` and the integer value is 3.

For a ``pandas`` data frame:

.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np
    import pandas as pd

    my_df = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randn(3, 3))

    project.put("my_df", my_df)


For a ``matplotlib`` figure:

.. code-block:: python

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    x = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(5, 3), layout="constrained")
    _ = ax.plot(x)

    project.put("my_figure", fig)

For a ``scikit-learn`` fitted pipeline:

.. code-block:: python

    from sklearn.datasets import load_diabetes
    from sklearn.linear_model import Lasso
    from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
    from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

    diabetes = load_diabetes()
    X = diabetes.data[:150]
    y = diabetes.target[:150]
    my_pipeline = Pipeline(
        [("standard_scaler", StandardScaler()), ("lasso", Lasso(alpha=2))]
    )
    my_pipeline.fit(X, y)

    project.put("my_fitted_pipeline", my_pipeline)

Back to the dashboard
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#. On the top left, create a new ``View``.
#. From the ``Elements`` section on the bottom left, you can add stored items to this view, either by double-cliking on them or by doing drag-and-drop.
