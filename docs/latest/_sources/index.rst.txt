Welcome to ``skore``
====================

With skore, data scientists can:

#. Track and visualize their ML/DS results.
#. Get assistance when developing their ML/DS projects.

   - Scikit-learn compatible :func:`~skore.cross_validate` provides insights and checks on cross-validation.

These are only the initial features: skore is a work in progress and aims to be
an end-to-end library for data scientists.
Stay tuned!
