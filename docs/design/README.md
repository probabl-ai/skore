# Skore Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

Welcome to the Architecture Decision Records (ADR) for Skore.

## What Are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records document the architectural and technical decisions made in a project. They help:

* Preserve the reasoning behind key choices.
* Guide new contributors in understanding the project's direction.
* Enable revisiting or revising decisions as the project evolves in an open way.

## How to Use This Folder

Each ADR is stored as a markdown file and follows a sequential numbering system. The ADRs are organized to address different aspects of the backend architecture. New contributors and stakeholders can start by reviewing the decisions below to understand the foundational choices.

## Updating ADRs

If you propose a new decision or change an existing one:

* Write a new ADR, referencing the previous one it supersedes (if applicable).
* Follow the [established ADR template](https://github.com/adr/madr/blob/4.0.0/template/adr-template.md), [local version available](./0000-adr-template.md).
* Submit it for team review and approval.
