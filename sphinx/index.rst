Welcome to ``skore``
====================

With skore, data scientists can:

#. Track and visualize their ML/DS results.
#. Get assistance when developing their ML/DS projects.

   -  Scikit-learn compatible :class:`skore.CrossValidationReporter` and
      :func:`skore.train_test_split` provide insights and checks on cross-validation
      and train-test-split.

These are only the initial features: skore is a work in progress and aims to be
an end-to-end library for data scientists.
Stay tuned!
