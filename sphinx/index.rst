Why skore?
----------

ML development is an art — blending business sense, stats knowledge, and coding skills.
Brought to you by `Probabl <https://probabl.ai>`_, a company co-founded by scikit-learn
core developers, skore helps data scientists focus on what matters: building impactful
models with hindsight and clarity.

Skore is just at the beginning of its journey, but we’re shipping fast! Frequent
updates and new features are on the way as we work toward our vision of becoming a
comprehensive library for data scientists, supporting every phase of the machine
learning lifecycle.

Key features
------------

-  **Track and Visualize Results**: Capture your intermediate ML/DS results without the
   overhead, while gaining deeper insights through intuitive visualizations of your
   experiments.

-  **Elevate Model Development**: Avoid common pitfalls and follow recommended
   practices with automatic guidance and insights.

   -  Enhancing key scikit-learn features with :class:`skore.CrossValidationReporter`
