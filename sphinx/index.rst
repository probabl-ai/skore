What is skore?
""""""""""""""

skore is a Python open-source library designed to help data scientists apply recommended
practices and avoid common methodological pitfalls in scikit-learn.

Key features
""""""""""""

-  **Diagnose**: catch methodological errors before they impact your models.

   -  :func:`skore.train_test_split` supercharged with methodological guidance:
      the API is the same as scikit-learn's, but skore displays warnings when
      applicable.
      For example, it warns you against shuffling time series data or when you have
      class imbalance.

-  **Evaluate**: automated insightful reports.

   -  :class:`skore.EstimatorReport`: feed your scikit-learn compatible estimator and
      dataset, and it generates recommended metrics and plots to help you analyze your
      estimator.
      All these are computed and generated for you in 1 line of code.
      Under the hood, we use efficient caching to make the computations blazing fast.

   -  :class:`skore.CrossValidationReport`: get a skore estimator report for each fold
      of your cross-validation.

   -  :class:`skore.ComparisonReport`: benchmark your skore estimator reports.

What's next?
""""""""""""

Skore is just at the beginning of its journey, but weâ€™re shipping fast! Frequent updates and new features are on the way as we work toward our vision of becoming a comprehensive library for data scientists.
